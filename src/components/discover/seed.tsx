      "This is a feature they share with the cestoda (tapeworms), although the two groups are not closely related.",
      "Adult stages live in the intestines of their host and uptake nutrients which have been digested by the host, directly, through their body surface.",
      "=== Proboscis === The most notable feature of the acanthocephala is the presence of an anterior, protrudible proboscis that is usually covered with spiny hooks (hence the common name: thorny or spiny headed worm).",
      "The proboscis bears rings of recurved hooks arranged in horizontal rows, and it is by means of these hooks that the animal attaches itself to the tissues of its host.",
      "The hooks may be of two or three shapes, usually, longer, more slender hooks are arranged along the length of the proboscis, with several rows of more sturdy, shorter nasal hooks around the base of the proboscis.",
      "The proboscis is used to pierce the gut wall of the final host, and hold the parasite fast while it completes its life cycle.",
      "Like the body, the proboscis is hollow, and its cavity is separated from the body cavity by a septum or proboscis sheath.",
      "Traversing the cavity of the proboscis are muscle-strands inserted into the tip of the proboscis at one end and into the septum at the other.",
      "Their contraction causes the proboscis to be invaginated into its cavity."

      "The proboscis bears rings of recurved hooks arranged in horizontal rows, and it is by means of these hooks that the animal attaches itself to the tissues of its host.",
      "The hooks may be of two or three shapes, usually, longer, more slender hooks are arranged along the length of the proboscis, with several rows of more sturdy, shorter nasal hooks around the base of the proboscis.",
      "The proboscis is used to pierce the gut wall of the final host, and hold the parasite fast while it completes its life cycle.",
      "Like the body, the proboscis is hollow, and its cavity is separated from the body cavity by a septum or proboscis sheath.",
      "Traversing the cavity of the proboscis are muscle-strands inserted into the tip of the proboscis at one end and into the septum at the other.",

      "The proboscis bears rings of recurved hooks arranged in horizontal rows, and it is by means of these hooks that the animal attaches itself to the tissues of its host.",
      "The hooks may be of two or three shapes, usually, longer, more slender hooks are arranged along the length of the proboscis, with several rows of more sturdy, shorter nasal hooks around the base of the proboscis.",
      "The proboscis is used to pierce the gut wall of the final host, and hold the parasite fast while it completes its life cycle.",
      "Like the body, the proboscis is hollow, and its cavity is separated from the body cavity by a septum or proboscis sheath.",
      "Traversing the cavity of the proboscis are muscle-strands inserted into the tip of the proboscis at one end and into the septum at the other.",

      "The proboscis bears rings of recurved hooks arranged in horizontal rows, and it is by means of these hooks that the animal attaches itself to the tissues of its host.",
      "The hooks may be of two or three shapes, usually, longer, more slender hooks are arranged along the length of the proboscis, with several rows of more sturdy, shorter nasal hooks around the base of the proboscis.",
      "The proboscis is used to pierce the gut wall of the final host, and hold the parasite fast while it completes its life cycle.",
      "Like the body, the proboscis is hollow, and its cavity is separated from the body cavity by a septum or proboscis sheath.",
      "Traversing the cavity of the proboscis are muscle-strands inserted into the tip of the proboscis at one end and into the septum at the other.",
